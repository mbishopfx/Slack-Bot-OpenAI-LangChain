### Slack AI Assistant with OpenAI and LangChain Integration

This project implements a Slack bot using the Slack SDK, Slack Bolt framework, and Flask, integrated with OpenAI's GPT models and LangChain for advanced conversational capabilities. The bot serves as a LocalAI assistant, leveraging custom embeddings to interact with a local document directory and provide context-aware responses. It includes the following features:

- **Slack Integration**: Listens for mentions and messages in Slack, responds using formatted text compatible with Slack's messaging syntax.
- **Conversational AI**: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT model (gpt-4o) with LangChain's Conversational Retrieval Chain to provide intelligent, context-driven responses.
- **Document Indexing**: Builds a searchable index from local files using LangChain's `VectorstoreIndexCreator` and OpenAI embeddings for document-based retrieval.
- **Custom Pretext**: Applies a predefined persona and formatting rules tailored for Slack responses.
- **Dynamic Bot User ID**: Automatically fetches and configures the bot's user ID for mention handling.
- **Flask Backend**: Provides an endpoint to handle Slack events, enabling seamless communication between Slack and the bot.

### Requirements
